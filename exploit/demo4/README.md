# Demo 4: Parallelism

Now for the important bit: We're going to use GNU Parallel to run this attack on multiple threads at once.

*Requires GNU Parallel, obviously.*

We're only going to select 16,384 public keys, but we're going to attack with 128 parallel processes.

## Run It Yourself

I recommend using the built-in Linux script timing utility, as so:

```terminal
time ./poc.sh
```

To compare this execution with a parallel linear search:

```terminal
time ./linear.sh
```

## Example Output

For the proof of concept:

```
FOUND IN 975 STEPS!
2e9e239800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

2483c6c13d9e3085dcddf14a5da7ba5b760017961860516f43514a16d45dea1d

SEE FOR YOURSELF IN key-pairs.json!

parallel: This job succeeded:
php ./search.php 12

real	0m46.926s
user	1m38.343s
sys	0m52.294s
```

For the linear script:

```
Linear Search - 116137 STEPS!
