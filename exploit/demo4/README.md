# Demo 4: Parallelism

Now for the important bit: We're going to use GNU Parallel to run this attack on multiple threads at once.

*Requires GNU Parallel, obviously.*

We're only going to select 16,384 public keys, but we're going to attack with 128 parallel processes.

## Run It Yourself

I recommend using the built-in Linux script timing utility, as so:

```terminal
time ./poc.sh
```

## Example Output

```

SEE FOR YOURSELF IN key-pairs.json!

Thanks for reading and playing along.
