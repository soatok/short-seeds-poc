# Demo 5: Statistical Collection

This is a bonus added after the blog post went live. What this does is repeat Demo 4 an arbitrary number of times,
then performs a statistical analysis on the results.

## Run It Yourself

```terminal
./sample.sh
```

This script _will_ take a while (possibly several hours for the default 100 number of samples). But when it's done,
a file named `results.csv` will be created in the `samples` subdirectory.

## Example Output

This was taken across 5 samples:

```
Proof of Concept:
	Avg. Steps: 819.6
	Avg. Time: 2.5778359889984

Linear Search:
	Avg. Steps: 64466.2
	Avg. Time: 8.0349870681763
```

You can find [the sample output files online](https://soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/results-5-samples.zip).

# END OF DEMO

Thanks for reading and playing along.

These ugly, unoptimized scripts were meant to demonstrate that the attack strategy works. There may be bugs, and there
may be more optimal ways to perform this attack than I am envisioning.

## What Does This Mean?

How this relates to Session: If you can get an approximate sqrt(N) speedup, you should be able to attack their 128-bit
seeds in a batch attack with a similar amount of work, and without needing to have sqrt(N) records in working memory.

That Ed25519 hashes the short seeds with SHA512 might obviate directly attacking the ECDLP (or using lattice attacks 
since most of the secret key bits are known to be zero), but there are ways to attack this in approximately 2^64 time.

The main bottleneck for this sort of attack is always memory. The goal of this tactic was to obviate the memory costs,
following [prior work in the cryptographic literature](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/PL00003816.pdf).

I don't claim to have the most optimal strategy on-hand. I invite other people to propose better attack strategies if
they can think of any.
