# Demo1: Proof-of-Concept

We start simple:

* Generate 256 distinct 16-bit seeds, and their corresponding public keys.
* Pass only the public keys to our search function.
* Try to find a collision, using an application of Pollard's Rho Method.

Despite the 2^16 search space, we typically find a collision in about 256 steps.

This is not surprising, because there are sqrt(2^16) public keys to work with already.

## Run It Yourself

```terminal
php poc.php
```
