# Demo 3: Less Than Sqrt(N) Public Keys

Now for some real fun:

* We're still going to work with 32-bit seeds.
* Let's only select 32,768 public keys. This is half the previous demo's selection.

Other than that, the attack code is the mostly same as the previous two demos, with one exception: Internal cycles are
treated as a NULL result, since the emphasis of this technique is attacking a batch of candidate public keys.

This can be a bit flaky, so it retries as soon as a NULL result is encountered, with a new starting point.
I had originally introduced a starting point to support parallelism, so we're going to leverage that for retries.
