# Demo 3: Less Than Sqrt(N) Public Keys

Now for some real fun:

* We're still going to work with 32-bit seeds.
* Let's only select 32,768 public keys. This is half the previous demo's selection.

Other than that, the attack code is the same as the previous two demos.

The actual number of steps can be quite wild: I've had it take less than 2 seconds to find a collision.

## Run It Yourself

```terminal
php poc.php
```

## Example Output
